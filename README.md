## 🧠 About the Project

The **AI SaaS Starter Kit** is a modern, full-stack boilerplate built to help developers and startups launch AI-powered software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications — fast.

With growing access to powerful AI APIs like OpenAI's  or Gemini, many developers have innovative product ideas but face challenges around user authentication, backend infrastructure, secure API design, and payment integration. This project removes those barriers by providing an end-to-end, production-ready starter template that takes care of the heavy lifting.

### 👇 Use Cases

This boilerplate can be adapted for a wide range of AI SaaS applications, including:

- ✍️ AI content or copywriting platforms  
- 🧾 Document summarization tools  
- 🧠 AI chat assistants or support bots    
- 🖼️ AI-based image generation dashboards
- 🖼️ AI-based image manipulation   
- 📊 Data insight or report generation tools
